title: Our software
---

All of our internally developed software tools have been made open source and are available from <a href="https://github.com/silicos-it/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. This is a policy that we strictly adhere as we believe that sharing software and technology ultimately leads to higher quality and faster progress in science.


### Shape-it

<a href="https://github.com/silicos-it/shape-it" target="_blank">Shape-it</a> is the shape-only rewrite of the original <a href="/assets/papers/hdw-pharao-paper.pdf" download target="_blank">Pharao work</a> by Silicos in 2008. It is based on the alignment method described by <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/j100011a016" target="_blank">Grant and Pickup</a>. Shape-it is a shape-based virtual screening method to retrieve molecules with similar shape from different compound libraries. It is widely used and has been cited numerous times.


### Spectrophores

<a href="https://github.com/silicos-it/spectrophore" target="_blank">Spectrophores</a> are a novel class of descriptors calculated from the three-dimensional atomic properties of molecules. The methodology finds its roots in the experimental affinity fingerprinting technology developed in the 1990’s by Terrapin Technologies. At Silicos, this was translated into a virtual approach using artificial affinity cages and a metric to calculate the interaction between these cages and atomic properties. Spectrophores are highly suitable for the calculation of a wide range of similarity measures for use in virtual screening and for the investigation of quantitative structure–activity relationships in combination with machine learning models. The method has been described in <a href="/assets/papers/hdw-spectrophore-paper.pdf" download target="_blank"><i>J. Cheminform.</i> (2018), <b>10</b>, 9</a>.


### LEADD

<a href="https://github.com/UAMCAntwerpen/LEADD" target="_blank">LEADD</a> stands for Lamarckian Evolutionary Algorithm for de novo Drug Design. LEADD designs molecules as combinations of molecular fragments, bonded according to the topology of a graph. Atom pair compatibility rules are enforced by a novel set of genetic operators, biased according to the frequency of the fragments in drug-like matter. A Lamarckian evolutionary mechanism adjusts the future reproductive behavior of molecules based on the outcome of previous generations. LEADD attempts to strike a balance between optimization power, synthetic accessibility and computational performance. The method has been described in <a href="/assets/papers/ak-leadd-paper.pdf" download target="_blank"><i>J. Cheminform.</i> (2022) <b>14</b>, 3</a>.


### MolPert

<a href="https://github.com/UAMCAntwerpen/Molpert" target="_blank">MolPert</a> is a software library for constrained graph-based molecule manipulation. The method has been described in <a href="/assets/papers/ak-molpert-paper.pdf" download target="_blank"><i>J. Cheminform.</i> (2023) <b>15</b>, 89</a>
