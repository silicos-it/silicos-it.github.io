**Silicos-it** is a Belgian consultancy company that was founded in 2010 and that is specialised in computational drug design. We provide support in all aspects of modern computational drug design, including virtual screening, molecular dynamics applications, and state-of-the-art structure-activity machine learning models. In addition, we are also involved in writing open source [software tools](/software).

Since 2013, a strong relation with the University of Antwerp (UA) was established. Because of this, we can provide you with a complete set of solutions to all your questions related to computational drug design. This may include service work under the wings of the UA, submission and execution of a VLAIO project with the UA as academic partner, or some well-defined fee-for-service projects with **Silicos-it** as the commercial partner. And due to our link with the UA, we have access to the university's extremely powerful Tier-2 supercomputer on which we can run your extensive computer simulations.
