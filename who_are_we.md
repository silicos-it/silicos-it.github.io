title: Who are we?

### Silicos

It all started in the summer of 2005. Three scientists, Wilfried Langenaeker, Gert Thijs, and Hans De Winter joined forces and founded the company **Silicos**. At that time, Wilfried and Hans were senior scientists at Johnson & Johnson in Belgium, and Gert was a postdoc in the lab of Prof. Bart De Moor at the Catholic University of Leuven. Backed-up by seed money and a starting grant from the Flemish IWT, the company quickly became a reference in computational drug design services. In 2009, with additional injections of venture capital, the company switched from fee-for-service towards a pure research-driven business model.


### Silicos-it

Around 2010, **Silicos-it** was established by Hans to further develop the software tools that were initiated by Silicos, and to use these tools to provide fee-for-services in the domain of computational drug design. This business model has continued since then and up to now. In addition, all of the developed [software tools](/software) have been made open-source and are currently being used in numerous companies and academic labs around the world.


### University of Antwerp

At the end of 2013, Hans became appointed as a professor in cheminformatics and computational drug design at the University of Antwerp (UA). This marked the beginning of a close relation between **Silicos-it** and the UA. New [software tools]( software) were developed and challenging research projects powered by the Tier-2 supercomputer of the university are now within reach of our customers. Under the wings of the UA, **Silicos-it** now has solutions to offer that are more than just fee-for-services. Instead, now we can also discuss government-funded collaborations involving academic/industry collaborations, or we can discuss projects that involve massive molecular simulations on the university's Tier-2 computer.
