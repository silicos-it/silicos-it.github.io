### Silicos

It all started in the summer of 2005. Three scientists, Wilfried Langenaeker, Gert Thijs, and Hans De Winter joined forces and founded the company **Silicos**. At that time, Wilfried and Hans were senior scientists at J&J, and Gert was a postdoc in the lab of Prof. Bart De Moor at the Catholic University of Leuven. The company quickly became a reference in computational drug design services.


### Silicos-it

Around 2010, **Silicos-it** was established by Hans to further develop the software tools that were initiated by Silicos, and to use these tools in the domain of computational drug design. This **fee-for-services** model has continued since then. In addition, all of the [software tools](/software) have been made open-source and are used in numerous companies and academic labs around the world.


### University of Antwerp

In 2013, Hans became appointed as professor in <a href="https://uamcantwerpen.github.io/2040FBDBIC/" target="_blank">cheminformatics and computational drug design</a> at the University of Antwerp (UA). This marked the start of a close relation between **Silicos-it** and the UA. New [software tools](/software) were developed and **Silicos-it** now has additional solutions to offer that was not possible before. For example, we can discuss government-funded collaborations, or we can engage on projects that involve massive simulations on exascale supercomputers.


### Many possibilities

We are open to many forms of fee-for-service collaborations. These may include services with the **UA as academic partner**, or with **Silicos-it as an industrial partner**. <a class="u-email" href="mailto:{{ site.social.email | join:',' }}">Therefore, let's talk to find out the best solution to your problem!</a>
