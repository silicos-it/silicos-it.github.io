We have just received a grant of the [ESF](https://esf.vlaanderen.be/esf/) to design and build a virtual reality platform to visualise protein-ligand interactions. In addition, the project will be used to create a blended learning environment for students to learn computational drug design as part of the [Biochemistry curriculum](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/study/programmes/all-programmes/biochemistry-biotechnology-programmes/) at the University of Antwerp. This project is in close collaboration with [Soulmade](https://soulmade.eu) who implemented the VR application. The resulting blended-learning curriculum is available at GitHub:

Many thanks to [Jurgen Menue](https://jm-consult.be) for the splendid support in writing the grant!
