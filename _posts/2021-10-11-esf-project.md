We have just received a grant of the <a href="https://esf.vlaanderen.be/esf/" target="_blank">ESF</a> to design and build a virtual reality platform to visualise protein-ligand interactions. In addition, the project will be used to create a blended learning environment for students to learn computational drug design as part of the <a href="https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/study/programmes/all-programmes/biochemistry-biotechnology-programmes/" target="_blank">Biochemistry curriculum</a> at the University of Antwerp. This project is in close collaboration with <a href="https://soulmade.eu" target="_blank">Soulmade</a> who implemented the VR application. The resulting blended-learning curriculum is available at Github:
