This paper in <a href="/assets/papers/stijn-dl-review.pdf" download><i>Journal of Cheminformatics</i></a> reviews how deep learning (DL) is being integrated into molecular modelling,
particularly in virtual screening (VS) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, to enhance drug discovery workflows. 
DL techniques are shown to improve accuracy, speed, and analysis of simulations by addressing limitations in traditional 
computational chemistry, such as hardware constraints and algorithmic inefficiencies. The review is structured 
around four key areas: DL-enhanced VS workflows, DL-guided MD simulations, neural network-based force field approximations, 
and DL-driven MD trajectory analysis. A broad range of DL models are presented —including convolutional neural 
networks, graph neural networks, and generative models like GANs and VAEs—alongside real-world applications 
such as DEEPScreen, DiffDock, and AlphaFold. The paper concludes that DL holds the potential to transform molecular 
modelling, but also notes challenges like data quality, model interpretability, and the need for broader accessibility and standardization.
