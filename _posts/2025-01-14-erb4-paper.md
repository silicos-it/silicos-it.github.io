A paper in which we contributed just came out in <a href=/assests/papers/erb4-paper.pdf" download><i><Nature Communications</i></a>. This paper presents exciting research on a potential new treatment for heart failure, a serious condition affecting many people. In this project, small molecules were discovered that can activate a protein called ERBB4, helping heart cells protect from damage. One particular compound, named EF-1, showed impressive results in reducing heart damage and fibrosis in experiments. A key part of the study involved using machine learning to analyze a vast library of compounds, helping to identify the most promising candidates for further testing.
