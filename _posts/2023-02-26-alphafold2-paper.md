Researcher at the University of Leipzig and Vanderbilt University have published an interesting paper (<a href="/assets/papers/alphafold2-paper.pdf" download><i>Front. Mol. Biosci.</i> (2023), <b>10</b>, 1121962</a>) that describes a new AlphaFold pipeline to model GPCRs and kinases with user-defined conformational states.

Users can specify which GPCR activation state (Active, Inactive, Intermediate) or kinase structural features (DFG=out, Ac_H=out) they want and the script will predict the desired characteristics. Their code works with ColabFold and is available on <a href="https://github.com/meilerlab/AF2_GPCR_Kinase" target="_blank">GitHub (meilerlab/AF2_GPCR_Kinase)</a>.
