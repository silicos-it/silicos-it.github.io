We are seeking a highly motivated and talented PhD candidate to join our collaborative research project between the AI & Algorithms group at IMEC (Leuven) and the University of Antwerpâ€™s Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry (UAMC), under the guidance of Prof. Hans De Winter. This is a unique opportunity to work at the intersection of cutting-edge technology and medicinal chemistry, contributing to the development of novel inhibitors for therapeutic protein targets through computational methods.

This PhD fellowship is a collaboration between IMEC (Leuven) and the University of Antwerp, Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry. 

**Job Description**

The successful candidate will be involved in a research project focused on the development and validation of software tools to automate cosolvent molecular dynamics simulations. The goal of this project is to accelerate the identification and optimization of inhibitors for several key therapeutic protein targets. You will:
- Develop, implement, and validate computational methods, machine learning techniques and software tools to streamline cosolvent molecular dynamics simulations.
- Collaborate closely with multidisciplinary teams at IMEC and the University of Antwerp to integrate computational approaches with experimental data.
- Contribute to the design and execution of research studies, analyzing data and interpreting results to advance the discovery of novel drug candidates.
- Prepare research articles for publication in peer-reviewed journals and present your findings at international conferences.
Engage in PhD courses and training sessions offered by the University of Antwerp and IMEC, enhancing both your scientific and transferable skills.
