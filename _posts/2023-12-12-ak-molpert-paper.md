"A molecule perturbation software library and its application to study the effects of molecular design constraints" is our recent paper (<a href="/assets/papers/ak-molpert-paper.pdf" download><i>J. Cheminform.</i> (2023), <b>15</b>, 89</a>) that has just been accepted in *Journal of Cheminformatics*. In this work we present a software library for constrained graph-based molecule manipulation and showcase its functionality by developing a molecule generator. Such a generator designs molecules mimicking reference chemical features of differing granularity. We find that restricting molecular construction lightly, beyond the usual positive effects on drug-likeness and synthesizability of designed molecules, provides guidance to optimization algorithms navigating chemical space.

Many thanks to Alan Kerstjens for the nice work!
