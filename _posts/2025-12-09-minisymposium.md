Together with Prof. Frederik Tielens (VUB) and Christophe De Bie (UA), we are organising a <a href="https://tickets.kvcv.be/kvcv/compchem25/">minisymposium on computational design</a>. On December 12, 2025, this minisymposium brings together leading researchers in the fields of computational drug discovery and materials science. Through a series of invited talks, we aim to explore current advances and foster dialogue between disciplines. Invited speakers are Dr. Sandro Boland (CISTIM / KU Leuven), Drs. Joep Wals (University of Antwerp), Dr. Edgar Jacoby (J&J), Dr. Maria Cecilia Oliveira (UA), Prof. Jeremy Harvey (KU Leuven), and Prof. Mark Saeys (Ghent University).
