title: Computational approaches streamlining drug discovery
categories: papers
---

A splendid review on computer-aided drug discovery was recently published in *Nature*. In this paper, the authors describe the rise of computational drug design in recent years due to the abundance of data on ligand properties, computing power, and virtual libraries of drug-like molecules. Computational drug design has the potential to reshape the drug discovery and development process, but it also faces challenges. At **Silicos-it**, we are equipped to help you with these tasks, so please do not hesitate to <a class="u-email" href="mailto:{{ site.social.email | join:',' }}">contact us</a> if you have a project that could benefit from these novel approaches.
