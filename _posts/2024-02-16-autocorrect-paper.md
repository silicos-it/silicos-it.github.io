Ensuring that computationally designed molecules are chemically reasonable is at best cumbersome. In this new paper (<a href="/assets/papers/autocorrect-paper.pdf" download><i>J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des.</i> (2024), <b>38</b>, 10</a>) by Alan Kerstjens we present a molecule correction algorithm that morphs invalid molecular graphs into structurally related valid analogs. The algorithm is implemented as a tree search, guided by a set of policies to minimize its cost. We showcase how the algorithm can be applied to molecular design, either as a post-processing step or as an integral part of molecule generators.

Many thanks to Alan Kerstjens for the nice work! The <a href="https://github.com/UAMCAntwerpen/MoleculeAutoCorrect" target="_blank">software is available from the UAMC Github page</a>.
