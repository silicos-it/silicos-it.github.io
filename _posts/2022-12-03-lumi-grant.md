We have just received a computing grant on the new exascale Tier-0 supercomputer [LUMI](https://www.lumi-supercomputer.eu). The available GPU computing resources will be used to study the dimerisation energetics of DPP9, and how this is influenced by inhibitor binding.

Many thanks to Kurt Lust and Stefan Becuwe of [CalcUA](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/core-facilities/calcua/) for the splendid support in reviewing the grant application!
