We just received a computing grant on the new exascale Tier-0 supercomputer <a href="https://www.lumi-supercomputer.eu" target="_blank">LUMI</a>. The available GPU computing resources will be used to study the dimerisation energetics of DPP9, and how this is influenced by inhibitor binding. State-of-the-art <a href="/assets/papers/ppi-gamd-paper.pdf" download target="_blank">Gaussian-accelerated molecular dynamics simulations</a> will be applied.

Many thanks to Kurt Lust and Stefan Becuwe of <a href="https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/core-facilities/calcua/" target="_blank">CalcUA</a> for the splendid support in reviewing the grant application!
