On May 31, 2024, the results from our collaboration with scientists from the biotechnology company reMYND have been published in <a href="/assets/papers/hdw-science-paper.pdf" download><i>Science</i> </a>.
In this collaboration, we used extensive LiGaMD simulations to confirm the binding location of reMYND's lead compound within a complex of several septin proteins. We also performed
umbrella sampling to qualitatively estimate the impact of this binding on the stability of the septin-6/septin-7 heterodimer. This interdisciplinary research work is a perfect example of the use of computational
tools to validate and explain biological hypotheses.
Many thanks to Marc Fivaz and all his colleagues of reMYND!
